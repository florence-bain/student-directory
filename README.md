# student-directory
The student directoy allows you to see all of the students
enrolled in the Villains Academy.

## How to use

When student-directory is run it will start by providing a menu of options to chose from.

The options are to enter students names and see the names along side which cohort they are enrolled in.
Save the names to a filename and later load the saved data from the filename. The final option
is to exit the program, it will not exit unless this option is selected.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/florence-bain/student-directory.git
cd student-directory
ruby directory.rb
```
